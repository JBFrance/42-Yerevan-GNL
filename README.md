Read a file line by line with an undetermined buffer_size


The Goal of this project was to read a file line by line. Each time the function is called it should return the next lien of the file.
The constraints are that the buffersize to read by can be changed at compile time making it possible to read the whole file in a single read,
or not enough. 

The bonus of the project requried that only a single static variable be used and that the program can handle reading from multiple file descriptors.
This one video saved a significant amount of time in understanding the project, I highly recommend for other students or the curious.
